            Today's entry is dedicated to two cities that surprised me a lot and that do not appear in the list of main visits in Morocco, perhaps because they are a little more "modern". <a href="https://thinkmorocco.com/things-to-do-in-rabat/">On one hand I will talk about Rabat, a must see</a>, and on the other hand I will tell you about the visit to its neighbour Sal&eacute;, a more classic and impressive city. <br><br><br /><br /><h2>One-day tour of Rabat</h2><br /><br /><p>Rabat is the capital of Morocco, a mixture of modernity and tradition. </p><br /><br /><p>Located on the Atlantic coast, it is the second city of Morocco in terms of population. </p><br /><br /><p>To move it is necessary to use public transport, you can take taxis at a good price bargaining or currently there is a modern tram network that takes you to most points of interest. Even so, taking a walk is also quite advisable to go around its streets (outside the medina).</p><br /><br /><p>Everyone in Rabat should visit the Tower of Hasam and the Mausoleum of Mohammed V. The visit was quite quiet and I was able to take the camera out (I'm not saying that in other places you can't, you always can, but as soon as you are seen with a camera it is possible that you take several people behind you to try to sell you something hehehe).</p><br /><br /><p>The Tower of Hasam was going to be the big minaret of the mosque that was being built, the aim is that it would be the most important one in the Islamic world. We are talking about 1195 and four years later the work was stopped. You'll see that it bears a certain resemblance to the Giralda in Seville.</p><br /><br /><p>As for the mosque, there are only columns left, but they help to imagine the dimensions. </p><br /><br />
